### Hi, I'm Phil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer interested in progressive political technology. Previously, I've spent many years working in educational technology.

I'm did a batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I'm learned about lower level coding via learning about binary exploitation, doing the Nand2Tetris course, and collaborating with other Recursers.

I currently work at Civitech, working on political tech/

One of my favorite projects I've worked on is [Meme It So](https://memeit.so), a Star Trek The Next Generation meme generator.
