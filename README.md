### Hi, I'm Phil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer interested in progressive political technology. Previously, I've spent many years working in educational technology.

I'm currently doing a batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I'm learning about lower level coding via learning about binary exploitation, doing the Nand2Tetris course, and collaborating with other Recursers.
